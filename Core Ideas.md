# Ideas for Government Reform

- Assigning limits to the amount of years a person can remain in a political career. For true democracy to happen, it must be illegal for the same people to remain in politics for decades on end, if the elected representatives cannot do it (presidents), then neither should other politicians. By making it so that the politicians are always changing, corruption becomes far harder to achieve and the system will always take in new blood, facilitating change and averting stagnation.

- Making general politics a core part of the curriculum. For true democracy to happen, the citizens must be educated in the operation of their rights and duties and must know how the decisions made by those in charge affect them and the country in general. This will also facilitate the entry of the average citizen in politics, which will make it so that it will stop being an occupation of the elites. A government by the people, for the people, that is the goal. The politics taught in schools must also be as general and unbiased as humanly possible without working against the system, making it so that there won't be schools that favor certain parties, which would further fragment the people and turn them against each other, making it easier for the elites to divide and conquer.

- Reversing the various privatizations that have been occurring. It is not wise for the state to control all companies, but vital suppliers, such as suppliers of energy and infrastructures as well as the basic needs for the people, should be under government control, to prevent rich corporations from inflicting unfair prices that will further the divide between rich and poor. There must be a balance, so that neither the forces of the government nor the elites have enough power to be able to control and supress the people.

- Encouraging a reversal of the trend of de-unionization. While unions have their flaws, they are one of the best ways to garantee that workers will always have their rights respected by their bosses. If a company cannot operate without giving fair conditions to their workers, they aren't deserving of success anyways.

- Creation of homeless shelters that will take enough care and train the homeless population so that they can leave poverty by their own hand, reducing the need for charity and the great divide between rich and poor.

- Ensuring that the environment is always respected, be it by companies, the state or the people themselves, so that life on Earth can continue in an easier way.

- Transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources must be mandatory and done carefully, especially for nuclear energy but also for wind power, as it can have a negative effect on local wildlife. Within a decade, almost all energy used by a country must be renewable. Once such is achieved, foreign investment should be based on renewable energy sources, to encourage the entire world to switch to alternate power sources that will not negatively impact life on the planet.

- Fierce fiscalization of the most polluting industries, so as to not allow any shortcuts in regards to either worker or environmental safety.

- Integration of immigrants and anti-racist laws as well as potential cheap or outright free courses for new citizens of the nation so they may learn the local language and culture, as well as how they should act, in this way, they can integrate smoothly within the local populace, while avoiding discrimination.

- Protection of religion and all relgious rituals provided they do not go against the laws of the nation.

- Protection of freedom of speech and expression, provided it does not result in people being harmed.

- Taxation directly proportional to earnings if such is not already the case.

- Protection and preservation of regional and historical languages and customs, lest they be erased from History.
