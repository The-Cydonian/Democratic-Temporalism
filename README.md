# Democratic-Temporalism
We believe the time for change is at hand. The current form of democracy has stagnated in corruption, and we seek a better sollution. It is time for humanity to move onwards!

We aim for our ideas to be heard, so that the world may change once more, like it did with the spread of absolutism, liberalism and socialism before it, it is time to take another step in the direction of progress. The end goal is that it eventually spreads so much that the governments of the world are forced to adress or even outright reform in such a way that the children of tomorrow will have a brighter future. A future where corruption is harder and where governance is no longer an occupation of the elites, but instead one that belongs to the general people.

By using github, anyone who has an account can suggest something else to reform and more specific stuff by making issues, tailored to the realities that they know instead of the more broad focus of the original proposed reforms. A government by the people, for the people.
